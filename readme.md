## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. This repository showcases various RL projects that demonstrate different aspects of RL, including environment setup, agent training, and performance evaluation.

## Projects

### CartPole

This project demonstrates the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the CartPole problem using OpenAI Gym.

- **Setup of the CartPole environment.**
- **Implementation of a reinforcement learning agent.**
- **Training process using DQN.**
- **Evaluation and visualization of the agent's performance.**

The `CartPole.ipynb` notebook contains the code and explanations for this project.

### Breakout

This project implements reinforcement learning techniques to solve the Breakout game using OpenAI Gym.

- **Environment setup for Breakout.**
- **Training process using DQN.**
- **Evaluation of the agent's performance and visualization of results.**

The `Breakout.ipynb` notebook contains the code and explanations for this project.
